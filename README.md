# TextMining
Information obtained from social media, like Twitter, can be very useful especially to get a sentimental analysis to know opinions based on feelings. These data can reveal hidden patterns discovered through the analysis and visualisation. In this work, three Twitter accounts related to the news were chosen to be analysed through their tweets. These tweets were pre-processed and cleansed using R language in RStudio to be get rated according to the emotional content identification and visualised in a pie chart. Also, a Term Document Matrix (TDM) was created to improve the processing and obtain a coloured Word Cloud that represents the most used words in these tweets. Moreover, associations to these frequent words were performed to find patterns of difference or similarity among Twitter accounts. Visualisations of text mining also included bar plots to display the different emotions implied by an assigned scoring. 

The analysis and comparisons of these results demonstrated a high proportion of negative words used by these Twitter accounts and most of the frequent terms were commonly utilized by them to describe the news. Finally, this report has achieved the extraction of an important story, based on these results, that reflects a strong and common trend discovered in these different tweets through this analysis.
